2 Tables will be made, one to list general info on the teams, the other to list standings and stats from the 2019 football season.

Number of columns will be expanded to make information easier to process.

For instance, 'Conference W-L' and 'Overall W-L' will each be split into separate columns for wins and losses.

Names of columns will be simplified to limit chance for typos when processing data on command line

Columns would be as follows

Table 1

School - String, primary key
Mascot - String
City - String
State - String

Table 2

Place - Integer
School - String, primary key
ConfW - Integer
ConfL - Integer
OvlW - Integer
OvlL - Integer
PF - Integer
PA - Integer
